- switches to enable/disable specific reaction wheels? LV(launch vehicle)/VESSEL(vessel)/POD(pod) 
- switches to enable/disable specific RCS thrusters? LV/POD
- science bay doors
- utility bay doors

- NAV REF -> SPD REF, with selector

- when and how to use korrys VS switches?
	- primary rule: light things up only if the pilot should look at it  
	- korry: 
		-> to show both the on/off state and some other information on a single place.
		-> when momentary action is preferred
		-> when the on/off state should be quickly visible
		-> or, *if if's a toggle action*, only when a switch guard is not necessary
		- consider default-on korrys?
			- in airbus/boeing overhead panels, most korry lights should be off _during normal operation_
				- facilitate quick visual scan for anomalies
				- startup: extinguish all OFF lights
			- what is _normal operation_ in KSP?
				- most things are ON by default
		- what other information?
			- FAULT
			- AVAIL
			- ACTY?


	- switches: only on/off state, other information elsewhere, or not necessary
		- use for things that are immediately visible
		- use when toggle operation is necessary and state should be guarded
    
    - by function:
    	- Thrust limiter
    		- only LIMIT is interesting
    		- OFF / [LIMIT] 
    		- --- / [LIMIT] 
    	- Lock engine gimbal
    		- FREE / [LOCK]
    		- FREE is normal operation
    	- SAS/RCS masters: probably a korry, but toggle action could work
    		- either ON or OFF could be considered normal operation 
    		- probably a ON-lit korry, maybe combined with an activity indicator or a ON/OFF korry
    			- [ON] / ACTY
    			- [ON] / OFF
    		- RCS master for the launch vehicle is useless since it's always on
    		- "vessel reaction wheel control", or "VSL TORQUE", "VSL RCS"
    			- toggle action: switch to ON after stage 1 sep, leave alone after

    	- Individual reaction wheels / RCS controls
    		- OFF is alternate operation
    		- ON / [OFF]
    	- Landing legs deploy mode
    		- auto or manual
    		- MANUAL / [AUTO]
    	- Gear up/down: toggle action
    	- Solar panels: toggle action
    		- korry: [DEPLOY]/FAULT
    	- Radiators: toggle action
    		- korry: [DEPLOY]/FAULT
    	- Undock: guarded toggle action
    		- undocking is momentary -> should be a guarded push button
    	- Cabin lights: toggle action
    	- Ext lights: toggle action
    	- Brake: toggle action
    	- Fairing: guarded toggle action
    	- Fuel cell: 
    		- apollo-style: switch
    		- airbus-style: korry with default OFF
    	- RAPIER mode
    		- toggle action
    		- korry: CLOSED/AIR ?


    - mix both
    	- choose arbitrarily, because both can work for toggle action

 	- depends on the quality of the prototype korry
 		- if not good or too expensive, fallback to 737-style overhead panel (toggle switches + backlit indicators)

 	- find more uses of korrys outside of the overhead panels
 	- the space shuttle cockpit doesn't use korrys at all (or single-light)
